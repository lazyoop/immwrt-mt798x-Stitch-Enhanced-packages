# Port		: "/dev/ttyS%" or "/dev/ircomm%" ("irda" connection), "/dev/ttyUSB%"
#		  (instead of "%" please put "0", "1", "2", etc.)
# Model		: use only, when Gammu doesn't recognize your phone model.
#		  Put it here. Example values: "6110", "6150", "6210", "8210"
# Connection	: type of connection. Use "fbus" or "mbus" or "dlr3" or
#		  "irda" (Infrared over sockets) or "infrared" (DirectIR)
#		  or "at19200" (AT commands on 19200, 8 bits, None parity,
#		  1 stop bit, no flow control) or "at115200" (AT commands on
#		  115200, 8 bits, None parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control)
#		  or "atblue" (AT over BlueTooth) or "dlr3blue" (FBUS
#		  over BlueTooth)
# SynchronizeTime: If you want to set time from computer to phone during
#		  starting connection. Do not rather use this option when want
#		  to reset phone during connection (in some phones need to
#		  set time again after restart)
# Logfile	: Use, when want to have logfile from communication.
# Logformat	: What debug info and format should be used:
#		  "nothing" - no debug level, "text" - transmission dump in
#		  text format, "textall" - all possible info in text format,
#		  "errors"  - errors in text format, "binary" - transmission
#		  dump in binary format
# Use_Locking	: under Unix/Linux use "yes", if want to lock used device
#		  to prevent using it by other applications
# GammuLoc	: name of localisation file
